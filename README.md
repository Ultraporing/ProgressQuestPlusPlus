# Progress Quest Plus Plus

## What is this?
A faithful C++ Port of the Progress Quest Game

Aims to keep the mechanics and gameplay 1:1 of the original Delphi Source code. Code and Data structures will differ, because of the language change.
But Save Files from the Original will not be compatible, because I don't understand enough of the Delphi VCL Components to Load and convert them.
Online Leader board like the Original may be added later.
