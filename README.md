# Progress Quest Plus Plus

## What is this?
A faithful C++ Port of the Progress Quest Game

Aims to keep the mechanics and gameplay 1:1 of the original Delphi Source code. Code and Data structures will differ, because of the language change. But will have Save File compatibility between this version and the original. Online Leader board like the Original may be added later.
